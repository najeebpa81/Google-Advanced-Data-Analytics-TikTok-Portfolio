# TikTok Claims Classification Project
### Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate – Capstone Project

## Project Background
Welcome to the TikTok data team scenario!

TikTok users can submit reports flagging videos and comments that contain **user claims**. These reports are sent to moderators for review, but the volume of reports has created a significant backlog that is difficult to address in a timely manner.

The data team at TikTok is developing a **predictive classification model** to determine whether a video contains a claim or presents an opinion. A successful model will help automate the initial triage of user reports, allowing moderators to prioritize higher-priority claims and reduce the overall backlog more efficiently.

This capstone project simulates that initiative by building an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline using a provided dataset of labeled TikTok videos.

## Objective
Develop a binary classification model to predict whether a TikTok video contains a **claim** (1) or an **opinion** (0), following the structured **PACE** workflow (Plan → Analyze → Construct → Execute) taught in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

## Repository Structure (PACE Workflow)
- **01_Project_Proposal/**  
  Project planning, stakeholder considerations, milestones, and deliverables.
  
- **02_Data_Understanding_and_Preparation/**  
  Initial data inspection, dataframe construction, cleaning, and preparation for analysis.
  
- **03_EDA_and_Visualization/**  
  Exploratory data analysis, key insights, and an interactive Tableau dashboard designed for non-technical stakeholders (executive summary).
  
- **04_Statistical_Tests/**  
  Hypothesis testing to inform feature selection and modeling decisions.
  
- **05_Regression_Modeling/**  
  Logistic regression baseline model development, evaluation, and interpretation.
  
- **06_Machine_Learning_Models/**  
  Advanced classification model(s) with feature engineering, tuning, and final evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Tableau** (interactive executive dashboard)
- Jupyter notebooks for reproducible analysis

## Key Outcomes
- Structured, documented workflow following industry-standard PACE methodology
- Interactive Tableau dashboard communicating insights to non-technical audiences
- Logistic regression baseline + final tuned classification model (e.g., Random Forest / XGBoost)
- Model performance metrics and interpretation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, etc.)

This project was completed as the capstone for the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate** and is shared here as part of my personal learning journey in data analytics and machine learning.
